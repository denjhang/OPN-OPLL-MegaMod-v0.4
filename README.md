# OPN-OPLL-MegaMod-v0.4
 The optimized OPN+OPLL music module removes many useless diodes, combines the design of RE2-YM2413, and uses copper to isolate the digital and analog grounds, which greatly reduces noise.  
 This hardware is verified and can be used with confidence. Note that only the original TL074C can be used, any other replacement models will cause continuous power supply noise, I tested LF347 and TL084 and both got noise.  
 To get a louder volume, please change R11, R14 to 10k; R3, R7 to 20k. I will restore the overall volume adjustment function in the next version.
